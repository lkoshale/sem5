Compilation  : make all
Delete executables : make clean


Ruuning Server : ./emailserver <PORT>
<PORT> can be any integer from 1025 to 65535  (0-1024 are system reserved) 
mostly port number from 8000 are for html connection
so we can use any port number from 8000-9000

ex: ./emailserver 8080

Running Client :  ./emailclient  <PORT>
client port number should be same as server port number

ex :  ./emailclient 8080

For testing :
run server and client in two different terminals as two different processes

only client will have the input interface , from client shell prompt give valid commands
as mentioned in the probelm , and it will show the servers response

if there is invvalid command the client will  give error and prompt again

for closing the emailclient use command QUIT
while for closing the sever use CTRL+C  (CTRL+Z stops the program but the scoket is released after 5 mins)
